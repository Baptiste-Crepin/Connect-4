    <p>
      The goal of this game is to align at least four pieces of the same color on a grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each player is given a color (by convention, the color is either yellow or red).
    </p>
    <p>
      One after the other, both players place a piece in the colums of their choise, the piece drops down until it has
      no more place left at the bottom in said colum, it is then the turn of the other player to play
    </p>
    <p>
      The winner is the player that first align (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) a serie of at least four
      consecutive piece of his color, in that case he will win one point.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the grid were to fill up without any of the two players having made an alignement, the game is declared a draw
      and each player wins one point.
